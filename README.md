# JavaScript Algorithms with TDD (Jest)

![Run Tests](https://github.com/JuliAlchemDev/fcc-hof-and-callbacks-with-tests/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)
![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JuliAlchemDev/fcc-hof-and-callbacks-with-tests/badge.svg?branch=main)



This repository contains a collection of JavaScript algorithm exercises developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with **Jest**.

The main goal of this project is not only to solve the algorithms, but to practice:
- Writing meaningful tests before implementation
- Incremental development through small commits
- Refactoring safely with test coverage
- Clear and consistent Git history

The exercises are inspired by FreeCodeCamp Higher Order Functions and Callbacks Labs.

- Jest (unit testing)
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub

## 🔁 Development Workflow

This project follows a strict TDD workflow:

1. **Write a failing test**
2. **Implement minimal code to pass**
3. **Refactor while keeping all tests green**
4. **Commit each step with clear, scoped messages**


The commit history intentionally shows this process step by step.

## ▶️ Running the Tests

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run all Tests:

```bash
npm test
```
